# legit-risk-classification
This is a totally serious library to assign risk to any vulnerability.

## Use
Run the script using python 2 or 3, on Windows, Linux, or MacOSX.

Input any information about your first vulnerability. This can be in any form, any information, any details. The smart algortithm will pull all relevant details from this input and sort it into a risk level.
The only limitation is that there must only be one newline, as that tells the program you are done entering your vuln information.
